# **About Me**

Hi my name is **{{ site.author.name }}** and I'm from India. :wave:<br> 
I am currently finishing my masters in data science. My interests include the various applications of statistics and machine learning in football. Besides the numbers, I'm also genuinely fascinated by the tactical side of the game, owing to my time as a writer/tactical analyst for Total Football Analysis.

Apart from football, I try to spend time on Kaggle. I'm also a part of the matplotlib social media team. 

Come say hi on [twitter](https://twitter.com/abhisheksh_98/)!
