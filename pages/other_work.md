### Writings 

Some of my other writings/blogs are listed below: 

* [Older Tactical Writings at TFA](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/author/abhishek-sharma): These are the stuff I wrote when I was cutting my teeth at [Total Football Analysis](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/). They're less data intensive and more focused on the tactical aspects of the game. My two favourites from back then are [this](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/match-analysis/premier-league-201920-arsenal-vs-burnley-tactical-analysis-tactics) and [this](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/match-analysis/tactical-preview/arsenal-201920-season-preview-scout-report-tactical-analysis-tactics). 

Apart from the site, I also wrote several profiles for their monthly magazine. 

* ["Creating Emoji Mosaic Art"](https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/emoji-mosaic-art/): A piece I wrote for matplotlib's official blog talking about a fun way to create emoji collages in matplotlib. 

### Vizzes

Most of my vizzes are in matplotlib. They're static, largely arbitrary and always about football. A collection can be found [here](https://twitter.com/i/events/1287573886700105728)
