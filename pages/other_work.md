**A list of some of my work from elsewhere on the internet** 

### Writings 


* [Older Tactical Writings at TFA](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/author/abhishek-sharma): These are the stuff I wrote when I was cutting my teeth at [Total Football Analysis](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/). They're less data intensive and more focused on the tactical aspects of the game. My two favourites from back then are 

  * [Arsenal 2019/20 Season Preview](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/match-analysis/tactical-preview/arsenal-201920-season-preview-scout-report-tactical-analysis-tactics) 

  * [Arsenal vs Burnley, 2019/20](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/match-analysis/premier-league-201920-arsenal-vs-burnley-tactical-analysis-tactics)

  Apart from the site, I also wrote several player and team profiles for their monthly magazine. 

* ["Creating Emoji Mosaic Art"](https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/emoji-mosaic-art/): A piece I wrote for matplotlib's official blog on creating emoji collages in matplotlib. 

### Vizzes

Most of my vizzes are made using matplotlib. They're static, largely arbitrary and almost always about football. A collection can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gyN-Vv2wgvZsNREMn1kGxMAU5BP7jbZm?usp=sharing)
