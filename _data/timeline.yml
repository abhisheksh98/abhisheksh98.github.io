  description: I'm currently completing my BBA(H) from Techno India University, Kolkata. During my first year here, I was
               inclined towards public policy-making, and represented my college at a few inter-city MUNs.
               But it was in the field of data science where I found my true passion and hence, that is what I decided to major in!
